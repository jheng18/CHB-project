    '''
    In the process of constructing a safe route, there are three verions of 
    the route being chosen/created: 
    (1) the safest route returned from the Google Map API;
    (2) the enriched route based on the safest route from Google API;
    (3) the altered route which may have some part(s)/step(s) being altered 
        due to a high dangerous score.
        
    In order to have good visualization in the website's map, the final list 
    of locations only include the locations that are returned from the Google 
    Map API at the very begining, and the alternative steps which replace the 
    dangerous locations. Since these most of these locations are returned 
    from the Google Map API, they are valid locations on the route; the 
    self-enriched steps (the steps that are being added because there isa 
    long distance between two locations) are not included, because these 
    self-enriched steps may not necessarily be the valid locations on a 
    route, but could possible be inside some buildings. 
    
    Inputs:
        google_route: the best route returned from the Google Map API
        enriched_route: the enriched route based on the best route from API
        altered_route: the altered route based on the enriched route

    Returns: final_route, which is a list of locations that would be dsplayed 
             in the map
